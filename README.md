# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is part of a Girls Who Code at UMD machine learning workshop I attended, focusing on learning about machine learning models and detecting fake news using various classification algorithms. The code was provided by the workshop, and my role was to execute and analyze the models to understand their application in real-world data scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- re
- string

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## My Analysis
I executed the provided code and analyzed the performance of each model. My findings include...
(Here you would detail your observations, any additional code you wrote for analysis, and conclusions.)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts and their application in the real world. It was exciting to see how something that looks so simple could perform very complex tasks. This experience has solidified my interest in pursuing further projects in machine learning, and I plan to delve deeper into these models to see what other kinds of problems I can solve with them. I also gained some experience in popular data science tools, such as .ipynb files, Jupyter Notebooks, and Google CoLab. My experience with R helped me understand most of the pandas functions that were used during the preprocessing stage, such as reading in CSV files, modifying columns, and merging dataframes.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Girls Who Code at UMD for providing the foundational code and their supportive community!
